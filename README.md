# SNHU-CS210-Project-Two

**Overview**
This repository contains the code for the Investment Growth Calculator project from my CS 210 course. The project demonstrates my ability to write well-documented and readable C++ code, design functional programs that meet industry standards, and use multiple programming languages to develop secure and efficient code.

**Project Summary**
The Investment Growth Calculator is designed to help users calculate the year-end balance and earned interest on an initial investment, both with and without additional monthly deposits. The user inputs the initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and the number of years for the investment. The program then calculates and displays the year-end balances and earned interest for both scenarios.

**Reflection**
**What program was it solving?**
    This project addresses the need for users to understand how their investments will grow over time with and without regular contributions. It helps in planning and decision-making regarding savings and investments.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I was particularly effective in structuring the program to be modular and readable. I ensured each function had a single responsibility, making the code easier to test and debug. Using descriptive variable names and comments throughout the code also added to its readability.

**Where could you enhance your code?**
By exploring different algorithms and data structures, I could optimize the calculations to handle larger datasets more efficiently. Expanding the program into a budget and investment application would significantly enhance it. This could include features such as tracking multiple investments, budgeting expenses, forecasting future financial scenarios, and providing detailed reports and visualizations. This would make the program more versatile and useful for personal finance management.

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this?**
The most challenging part of the code was ensuring accurate calculations of the monthly and yearly interests, especially when dealing with floating-point arithmetic. I overcame this by thoroughly testing the program with different input values and comparing the results to manual calculations to ensure accuracy. Additionally, using online resources and community forums helped clarify concepts and best practices.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?**
Modular programming, code documentation, and problem-solving skills are highly transferable to other projects. The ability to break down a problem into manageable parts and write clean, maintainable code is crucial for any programming task. The experience gained in handling user inputs and performing calculations will be useful in many other applications.

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I made the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by following best practices in code documentation, using descriptive variable and function names, and structuring the code into logical sections. I also wrote the code so that new features or changes can be easily integrated without requiring extensive modifications to the existing codebase. Commenting on the code and providing clear user instructions further maintained its maintainability.
