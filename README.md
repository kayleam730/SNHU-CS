# SNHU-CS210-Project-Two

**Overview**
This repository contains the code for the Investment Growth Calculator project from my CS 210 course. The project demonstrates my ability to write well-documented and readable C++ code, design functional programs that meet industry standards, and use multiple programming languages to develop secure and efficient code.

**Project Summary**


**Reflection**
**What program was it solving?**
    This project addresses the need for users to understand how their investments will grow over time with and without regular contributions. It helps in planning and decision-making regarding savings and investments.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I was particularly effective in structuring the program to be modular and readable. I ensured that each function had a single responsibility, which made the code easier to test and debug. The use of descriptive variable names and comments throughout the code also added to its readability.

**Where could you enhance your code?**
I could enhance my code by implementing more robust input validation to handle edge cases and invalid inputs more gracefully. Additionally, I could optimize the calculations to handle larger datasets more efficiently, possibly by exploring different algorithms and data structures.

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this?**
The most challenging part of the code was ensuring accurate calculations of the monthly and yearly interests, especially when dealing with floating-point arithmetic. I overcame this by thoroughly testing the program with different input values and comparing the results to manual calculations to ensure accuracy. Additionally, using online resources and community forums helped clarify concepts and best practices.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?**
Skills such as modular programming, code documentation, and problem-solving are highly transferable to other projects. The ability to break down a problem into manageable parts and write clean, maintainable code is crucial for any programming task. Additionally, the experience gained in handling user inputs and performing calculations will be useful in many other applications.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by following best practices in code documentation, using descriptive variable and function names, and structuring the code into logical sections. I also wrote the code in a way that new features or changes can be easily integrated without requiring extensive modifications to the existing codebase. Commenting the code and providing clear instructions for users further added to its maintainability.
